I have completed two certification programs from Infosys Springboard. The first certificate is in HTML5 - The Language, where I gained comprehensive knowledge and skills in HTML5, enabling me to design and develop dynamic and interactive web pages. The second certificate is in Introduction to Preprocessing, where I learned fundamental techniques for preparing and processing data for analysis and machine learning tasks. These certifications have equipped me with valuable skills in web development and data preprocessing, enhancing my capabilities for various technical roles.
